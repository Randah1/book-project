  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Our idea was born within the halls of Umm Al-Qura University’s library, where we noticed that many valuable academic books often go unnoticed. That's why we created this platform: an interactive space where readers can share the benefits they've gained from books, and help others discover the right resources for their studies or teaching.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    We believe that knowledge grows not only through reading, but through sharing. Our mission is to make academic content more accessible by offering real, peer-written summaries and reviews that guide users toward the most relevant books.
  </p>

  <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
  <p>
    Our platform is designed for Umm Al-Qura University students, faculty members, and anyone who relies on the university library for academic, teaching, or research purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Team</h3>
  <p>
    Behind the platform is a dedicated team of students who understand firsthand the academic challenges faced by their peers. With the support of academic advisors, we work together to ensure the content is accurate, helpful, and meaningful.
